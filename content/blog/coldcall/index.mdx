Cold call was a concept I was first introduced to after reading <a href="https://teachlikeachampion.com/books/teach-like-champion-2-0">Teach Like a Champion</a> prior to my first year of teaching.

Here's a quick example:

There's a lot that I initially liked about the technique:

1. It communicates that the teacher has high expectations for every student.

1. It ensures that a wider variety of students have the opportunity to answer questions, not only those who actively volunteer.

1. It quickly and randomly assesses whether students have understood the material.

When I tried the technique out during my first year of teaching, it did not go well. Like many first year teachers, I struggled with classroom management and creating a positive learning environment for my students. Sometimes, when I randomly called on a student who did not know the answer, they would lash out and accuse me of purposely calling on them to embarass them.

But even with a more positive environment, I still wondered whether I was truly being random or if there were certain biases I had that unconsciously made me call on some students more than others. I also sometimes found myself hesitant to call on students who I thought might not know the answer and had to actively fight this hesitation.

After my first year, I made a few modifications to the cold call technique that tried to address these concerns.

### Totally Random

I found out that some teachers used popsicle sticks as a way to randomly call students. In this technique, each student has their name on a popsicle stick that goes into a class jar. When the teacher needs to call on a student, they choose a popsicle stick.

As one of the teachers mentions above, students no longer can complain about being "picked on" since the choice is random. I also appreciate how the teacher spins it as the student being "destined to answer the question" as it makes being chosen seem more like an opportunity instead of a punishment.

Rather than using popsicle sticks and a jar I used some index cards and added them to card game sleeves along with some of my old Magic the Gathering cards to provide a solid backing. Each card had a student's name For each class, I'd use a different color sleeve to differentiate the card decks.

### No Tricks up These Sleeves

I ultimately decided to assign card drawing duties to a different student each class. At the begining of class, I'd draw one card and pass the deck of cards to the person selected. I initially did this because I found it was unwieldy to carry around a deck of cards to different locations as I was demoing a problem or writing on the board, but I soon realized a couple of additional benefits.

1.  Being selected to be "card master" of the day was always a pleasant surprise for most students. At first, I was surprised how much joy students got out of being card master for the day, but I later realized that the increased responsibility meant a lot to students, particularly those who may have been struggling with the material.

2.  This ruled out all possibility that I could target a student. If I picked each card, I could theoretically call on a student other than the student on the card.

### Setting Expectations for Cold Call

Besides ensuring that the selection process was truly random, my students became more receptive to cold calling because at the beginning of the year, I emphasized that cold call served two purposes:

1. It's my way of checking whether a random group of students understood what I was teaching. If a student got a questiong wrong, it's my fault for not explaining clearly.

1. It's my way of showing the class that I'm confident that everyone can understand the material and answer the questions I ask. If a student struggles to answer, that's ok, and I'm happy to help them work through the question.

It is truly important to emphasize these points as students can interpret cold call as a "gotcha" otherwise.

### When to Use Cold Call

In the video above, the teacher asks students to solve quite cognitively intense questions with cold call. I, however, found cold call most effective when working to solve a multistep problem where I could pepper students with quick questions about one step of a process. For example, imagine checking student understanding for solving a simple algebra problem:

```
3x + 10 = 16
```

<h4>Oversimplified Cold Call Example</h4>

> Teacher: So to solve this problem, what's our goal? Card.
>
> Card Master (CM): Raul.
>
> Raul: We need to get x alone.
>
> Teacher: Got it. So what should be my first step? Card.
>
> CM: Jasmine.
>
> Jasmine: Subtract 10 from both sides.
>
> Teacher: Ok, what do I get when I do that? Card.
>
> CM: Ana.
>
> Ana: 3x = 6.
>
> Teacher: Ok. What's next? Card.
>
> CM: Johan.
>
> Johan: Divide both sides by 3.
>
> Teacher: Ok, what do we get if we do that, Johan?
>
> Johan: x = 2.
>
> Teacher: Hmm... does that seem reasonable? Card.
>
> CM: Michelle.
>
> Michelle: Yeah, 6 divided by 3 is 2. So x should be two. Stop playing, Mr. King.
>
> Teacher: Oh, you're right! That's my bad. :)

Within a couple minutes, the above rapid-fire conversation involved five students in a process that traditionally might only provide one student the opporunity to answer. While the downside is that we don't know for sure that any one student can completely solve the problem, we are able to get some understanding of potential blockers from multiple students. This is a tradeoff I'm willing to make most of the time. Generally, I'll also follow up a problem like this with some solo work time, which gives better insight into the whole process (the traditional "I do, we do, you do").

I also enjoyed adding in metacognitive questions throughout the rapidfire cold call, particularly asking students whether the answer seemed reasonable. For me, it was important to do so both when the students were correct and incorrect. Otherwise, the fact that the teacher is asking the question is giveaway that the previous student made an error. It also communicates to students that sanity checking answers is a good practice whether they think they're right or wrong.

### Final Reflection

Cold calling became a staple in my classroom throughout all my years of teaching and it's a technique I'd implement again if I returned to the classroom. It requires such a small investment, but has significant benefits. It:

1. Communicates a clear expectation that everyone can understand the material and will be asked to contribute.

1. Includes more students in answering questions compared to a volunteer based system.

1. Minimizes the time needed to call on a student (compared to waiting for students to raise hands, providing sufficient wait time, and finally choosing a student).

1. Eliminates teacher biases that may unconsciously surface if a teacher "randomly" chooses a student.

Generally, for any technique, I think there are tradeoffs, but I have a hard time rationalizing significant downsides with cold call. Perhaps it might:

1. Decrease engagement for students who enjoy raising their hand and actively participating?

1. Stress out students who do not handle pressure or being put on the spot?

I've never personally experienced any student actively rejecting cold call once it became clear why I cold called. There may have been certain days where a student told me they were not in a mood to participate, but those can be handled on a case by case and day by day basis. That's not to say that the second question of adding stress to a students' learning experience shouldn't be honored. If a student is truly stressed with being put on a spot, then it's important the teacher adjust and find a different opportunity for the student to share their understanding.

### Opportunity Calls

Perhaps my biggest complaint about cold call has to do with its name. It's true that if done with the intention of being a "gotcha", it can create a cold war between the student adn teacher. If it's done with the intention of supporting the student, however, it can communicate a sense of belief in each student and create a safe space to be wrong. In my last year of teaching, I started introducing the procedure as "Opportunity Calls". Students always groaned upon introduction, but I like to think that they warmed up to the opportunity to shine.
