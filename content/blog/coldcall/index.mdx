Cold call was a concept I was first introduced to after reading through <a href="https://teachlikeachampion.com/books/teach-like-champion-2-0">Teach Like a Champion</a> prior to my first year of teaching.

Here's a quick example:

There's a lot that initially resonated with me about cold call:

1. The process communicates to students that the teacher has high expectations for all students so that they're not afraid to call on any student.

1. It ensures that all students have the opportunity to answer questions, not only those who actively volunteer.

1. The process more randomly assesses whether studnets understand the concepts that are being taught.

I tried out a similar style of cold call during my first year of teaching. It did not go well. Some of the issues were not related to the technique itself. As a first year teacher, I certainly struggled with classroom management and setting high expectations. Students understandably became frustrated because they felt like I was picking on them when they didn't know the answer.

But there were other issues with cold call that were harder to address. How could I ensure that I was truly being random and ensure I was calling on students equally? Without a truly random process, I may have unconsciously been calling on some students more than others. In other cases, students felt like I was directly targeting them when I randomly called on them.

After my first year, I made a few modifications to the cold call technique that tried to address these concerns.

### Totally Random

After my first year, I went back to the drawing board and learned that some teachers used popsicle sticks as a way to randomly call students. At the beginning of the year, each student writes their name on the popsicle stick that go into a jar. When the teacher needs to call on a student, they choose a popsicle stick.

As one of the teachers mentions above, students no longer can complain about being "picked on" since the choice is random. I love how the teacher spins it as the student being "destined to answer the question" as it makes it seem like an opportunity to show off what you know.

Rather than using popsicle sticks, I put my own spin on it by using some old Magic cards and card game sleeves. Each card/sleeve would have a student's name and I would randomly draw a card when I needed to call a student. For each class I taught, I'd use a different color sleeve to differentiate the classes.

### No Tricks up These Sleeves

Students at times were still unconvinced that the process was truly random, however. It's theoretically possible that I could call on a name different than the card I drew if I really wanted to call a student. To make sure this wasn't the case, I ended up assigning card drawing duties to a different student each class.

At the begining of class, I'd draw one card and pass the deck of cards to the person selected. Being selected to be "card master" of the day was always a pleasant surprise for most students. At first, I was surprised how much joy students got out of being card master for the day, but even some increased responsibility means a lot to students, particularly those who may be struggling with the material.

An additiona benefit was that it delegated a task to my students so that I could have greater flexibilty in moving around the room and could also model or demo a concept with both of my hand without having to put something down to draw a card.

### Setting Expectations for Cold Call

Besides ensuring that the selection process was truly random, I also became a better cold caller because I explained at the beginning of the year, that cold call was my way of assessing student understanding and not a gotcha for students. It was important to show that if a student got a question wrong, it meant that I needed to do a better job teaching the material, and not that they should feel embarassed about not answering correctly.

### Types of Questions to use Cold Call

In the video above, the teacher asks students to solve two part problems with cold call. In my own experience, it was rare that I used to cold call in this manner. Instead, I found cold call most effective when working with the entire class to solve a multistep problem where I could pepper both questions about process and metacognition. For example, imagine checking student understanding for solving a simple algebra problem:

```
3x + 10 = 16
```

The conversation might go like this:

Teacher: So to solve this problem, what's our goal? Card.

Card Master (CM): Raul.

Raul: We need to get x alone.

Teacher: Got it. So what should be my first step? Card.

CM: Jasmine.

Jasmine: Subtract 10 from both sides.

Teacher: Ok, what do I get when I do that? Card.

CM: Ana.

Ana: 3x = 6.

Teacher: Ok. What's next? Card.

CM: Johan.

Johan: Divide both sides by 3.

Teacher: Ok, what do we get if we do that, Johan?

Johan: x = 2.

Teacher: Hmm... does that seem reasonable? Card.

CM: Michelle.

Michelle: Yeah, 6 divided by 3 is 2. So x should be two. Stop playing, Mr. King.

Teacher: Oh, you're right! That's my bad. :)

Within a couple minutes, the above rapid-fire conversation involved five students in a process that traditionally might only provide one student the opporunity to answer. While the downside here is that we don't know for sure that any one student can completely solve the problem, we are able to get some understanding of potential blockers from multiple students. This is a tradeoff I'm willing to make most of the time. Generally, I'll also always follow up a problem like this with some solo work time, which gives better insight into the whole process.

I found it really powerful to add in metacognitive questions about checking each other's work. This should be done both in cases where a student did something right or wrong so that students don't assume just because you're asking a question that the previous student did something wrong.

During the conversation, I'm generally writing down what students are telling me on the board. If I were to need to flip a card at the same time, it'd break the flow. By having students be responsible for the card flipping, I can focus my attention on following students' comments all while updating the problem.
