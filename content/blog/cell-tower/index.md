title: Cell Tower Prototype (Part 1) - Inspiration and Context
date: "2020-06-13"
description: "In the Cell Tower prototype, I attempt to show how establishing a real world context for math problems can provide opportunities for students to solve problems in meaningfully different ways and provide a legitimate reasons for students to collaborate and compare their solutions. This post highlights the inspiration for creating this prototype and my journey to the ultimate prototype."

1. I recently became interested in culturally based learning mathematics from a couple of articles, including an edutopia post and a white paper()[] by Currciulum Associates (disclaimer: I currently work here).

### Motivation

When I taught high school chemistry, I spent a significant amount of my time taking problems from textbooks and figuring out ways to connect them to students' lives or contextualize them so that they would at the very least see how solving a problem would be relevant to a professional chemist.

Recently, I became interested to see whether there was any research supporting the efficacy of this method and stumbled upon culturally responsive teaching. While cultural responsiveness emphasizes levearging students' existing knowledge and sociocultural background, it still resonated with me because it's ultimately trying to contextualize a problem that's meaningful to students' lives.

In a [summary of a research paper](https://news.ku.edu/2019/04/19/study-examines-benefits-teaching-math-culturally-responsive-ways) that analyzed 35 peer reviewed studies on culturally responsive mathematics, I found the following to resonate with my own experiences teaching:

> The studies also showed that culturally responsive mathematics approaches encouraged students to use their higher-level thinking skills, such as analysis, reasoning and evaluation. For example, the studies in the synthesis prepared students to use multiple strategies to solve problems and justify their solutions.

I soon found more reading on culturally respponsive mathematics teaching (CRMT), including a [white paper](https://www.curriculumassociates.com/-/media/mainsite/files/ready-classroom-mathematics/ready-classroom-mathematics-cultural-responsiveness-whitepaper-2019.pdf) on the topic that highlighted one example of a "lesson focused on identifying possible locations for a new cell phone tower near [the students'] school site." After looking at the [teacher resources](The teacher guide and resources to the lesson can be found [here](https://www.scribd.com/document/366617413/tacib-cell-towers-unit?secret_password=QSO3ygjBeFnOFdO3seZ4#from_embed) provided for the lesson, I soon realized a few things:

1. This was not just a single lesson and more an entire unit built that could span 1-2 weeks.
2. Because this was a real world problem, the unit required students to read articles about how cell phone towers worked, understand a little bit about the science behind waves and their application to information transfer ([a next gen science standard!](https://www.nextgenscience.org/dci-arrangement/ms-ps4-waves-and-their-applications-technologies-information-transfer)), and ultimately write an argumentative essay for whether a cell tower should be installed.
