### Current Digital Pythagorean Theorem Problems

I first looked at a few commonly used pythagorean problems to have a point of comparison. Here are a couple examples from IXL and Khan Academy:

These questions can be effective for a quick check of student understanding, but do little to meet the objectives we established in <a href="">part 1</a>:

1. Prepare students to use multiple strategies to solve problems and justify their solutions.

2. Situate mathematics problem-solving within a real world context so students can connect how applying math can help solve real problems and make more informed decisions in their lives.

### First Attempt

The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/366617413/tacib-cell-towers-unit?secret_password=QSO3ygjBeFnOFdO3seZ4#from_embed" target="_blank">cell tower unit presented by TACIB</a> already established a strong context by asking students to determine whether cell towers should be built near their school. Because the calculations in the unit are done to inform this decision, students can see how solving math problems can help them make more informed decisions in their local community.

With the TACIB unit as a reference, I started with the following prototype.

<PrototypeOne />

I liked the following about the prototype:

1. It makes a clear connection between solving a problem and gaining a piece of useful information. By applying the Pythagorean theorem, one can determine whether a household can receive cellular service. The wording of the question here is critical. Rather than asking students to calculate the distance between the cellular tower and each of the three households, I explicitly choose to ask about whether they receive cell coverage. This puts the emphasis on the impact of solving the problem. What matters here isn't the distance, but whether people can actually get coverage.

2. In one problem, we offer three opportunities for students to apply the Pythagorean theorem. This gives us some flexibility in how we use this problem. A teacher could for example, follow an "I do, we do, you do" approach in which they model with one household, get student volunteers to work together on computing another problem, and ask students to determine the last problem.

3. Another approach could be to ask a group of students to split up the households so that they could each calculate the distance of one household, compare and contrast their work, and as a group make a team decision about whether all households would receive cell phone coverage.

4. There is some opportuniy for students to solve this problem differently in meaningful ways. For example, students certainly can calculate the distance between every household and the cell tower, but some students might first estimate the distance of each household to the cell tower. They can then determine that certain households that are well within range and do not need an additional calclulation.

Here's what I still wanted to improve:

1. Ultimately, the primary work is still performing a calculation and at most reaches the "apply" level of <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/" target="_blank">Bloom's taxonomy</a>. While it's important teachers offer problems that do assess these lower levels of remembering, understanding, and applying, with some adjustments, this problem can also offer opportunities for more critical thinking.

2. There is still only one right answer to the question. Again, there's nothing exactly wrong with this, but I also think there's real value to showing students that there can be multiple reasonable answers to a problem. This naturally unlocks opportunities to compare and contrast answers, communicate tradeoffs, and attempt to justify the better approach for a specific context. These are all objectives that require students to reach for higher levels of critical thinking.

### Second Attempt

<PrototypeTwo />

One of the most common ways I moved to the higher tiers of Bloom's taxonomy during my teaching career was to ask students to optimize for the minimum or maximum quantity required. In the example above, I ask students to optimize for the minimum number of cell towers that can be placed. Students now need to actually design and lay out where the cell towers should be placed. This requires them to iterate over a few options, compare and contrast these options, and ultimately justify which option makes the most sense.

In addition, there can now actually be different answers that all meet the requirement. As a teacher, what excites me most is the opportunities this provides students when they compare and constrast answers with each other. In more straightforward problems, when students are asked to check their answers, they simply see if their answers match. If so, there's no further discussion. In a problem like this, however, even if both students agree on the minimum number of cell towers, they may still have placed each cell tower in a different location. This might lead to students taking a more critical look at each other's work to make sure that all households are indeed within cell tower range.

### Final Touch up

<PrototypeThree />

There are two small updates here.

1. The question has been changed from "What is the minimum number of cell towers that need to be built so that all households get cell coverage?" to "How many cell towers should be built and where?"

2. I added one house at coordinates (13, 14).

The more open ended question allows students to justify a greater variety of answers. While I imagine most students will still attempt to minimize the number of cell towers that covers all households, by making one house an outlier, a few students might question whether it's optimal to cover all households or just the majority of households.

When such questions are asked, we can begin exploring real issues in our society. For example, is it ok to leave certain households outside of cell service range? In the real world, decision makers need to weight the tradeoffs of different approaches and rarely does a single decision benefit everyone. By providing problems that enable opportunities for different answers, we provide an opportuniy for student to start grappling with these challenging questions.

I hope this problem also communicates that even if we correctly solve the math problem, that in itself does not completely dictate our answer. Instead, solving the math problem enables us to make a more informed decision. Depending on our priorities (minimizing costs vs ensuring equitable access), we may arrive at different solutions.

### Trade Offs

There are some valid concerns with the prototype still, including:

1. As problems become more open ended, it becomes harder to guarantee that students will solve the problem using one exact method. This makes it difficult to assess whether students have actually mastered the Pythagorean theorem since this particular problem can also be solved with other techniques.

1. Students also need to spend more time on other aspects of the problem that are unrelated to applying the Pythagorean theorem. For example, in the final iteration of the prototype, they need to analyze a few places where the tower can be placed before they can even do any calcluations.

1. Despite not taking the full one or two weeks the original TACIB problem would have taken, this problem will still require more class time to solve than the traditional problems first presented in this post.

1. The problem alone does not necessarily force students to engage with social justice issues. A teacher may need to prompt this discussion by providing an example to the class or ask guiding questions to help students think outside of the box.

These are all valid concerns. I acknowledge that every problem in the curriculum likely can't be this open ended given the emphasis on state testing and standards coverage. I do think, however, there's significant value in having at least one problem like this, which really pushes students to solve meaningful and open ended problems, every couple of weeks.

In part three, I'll try to justify that these tradeoffs are worth it by incorporating this problem into a complete lesson plan.
