### Analysis of Current Digital Lessons on Pythagorean Theorem

With this in mind, I started researching what digital tools currently offered.

For the most part, digital tools available to students offer opporunities for students to practice their use of the formula, but offer not too much context that would contextualize the concept for learners. In addition, these problems are very straightforward in how learners can solve the problem. Here are a couple examples from IXL and Khan Academy:

#### IXL - [(More Examples)](https://www.ixl.com/math/grade-7/pythagorean-theorem-find-the-length-of-the-hypotenuse)

#### Khan Academy - [(More Examples)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo/basic-geometry-pythagorean-theorem/geo-pythagorean-theorem/e/pythagorean_theorem_1)

These types of problems are effective for quick checks of understanding from students at the end of a class. The trade off is that they do little to excite students about mathematics or provide a real world context where the theorem might be useful. The IXL example, in particular, feels like a forced example of trying to use a word problem to establish a context.

If we were to translate the cell tower problem to fit one of these common digital formats, it'd likely take the form of something like:

> A cell tower has a range of 4 km. Commander King is considering buying a new house. To get to the new house from the cell tower, he would need to walk 2 km east and then 3 km south. Will his new house get cell service?

This problem feels slightly better than the IXL example, but only marginally. While students can better relate to the frustration of not having cell service, they'll still rightly question why a person couldn't just test the cell service when at the new house location. Students really need to forget reality in order to make sense of the problem at hand.

The problem also still funnels the user to take a single approach. Because of the clear parameters and constraints,

### Design Constraints

- Meets two Common Core Standards on Pythagorean Theorem
  1. CCSS.Math.Content.8.G.B.7 - Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to determine unknown side lengths in right triangles in real-world and mathematical problems in two and three dimensions.
  1. CCSS.Math.Content.8.G.B.8 - Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between two points in a coordinate system.
- Provides opportunities for students to take a different approach to solve the problem
