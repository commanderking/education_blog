### Summary

In this <a href="/prototypes/celltower" target="_blank">prototype</a>, I attempt to show how establishing a real world context for math problems can:

- Provide opportunities for students to solve problems in meaningfully different ways and provide a reason for students to collaborate and compare their solutions.
- Show students that mathematical calculations can play an important role in making impactful social and policy decisions.

Part 1 highlights the inspiration for creating this prototype and what research and personal experiences led to my wanting to create the prototype in the first place.

### Culturally Responsive Mathematics

When I taught high school chemistry, I spent a significant amount of my time taking problems from textbooks and figuring out ways to connect them to students' lives or contextualize them so that they would at least see how solving a problem would be relevant to a professional chemist.

Recently, I became interested to see whether there was any research supporting the efficacy of this method and stumbled upon culturally responsive teaching. While cultural responsiveness places a greater emphasis on leveraging students' existing knowledge and sociocultural background to help them solve problems, it similarly wants to contextualize a problem to make it meaningful to a student's life.

In a <a href="https://news.ku.edu/2019/04/19/study-examines-benefits-teaching-math-culturally-responsive-ways" target="_blank">summary of a research synthesis</a> by two researchers at Kansas University that analyzed 35 peer reviewed studies on culturally responsive mathematics, I found a couple of points particularly interesting:

> The studies in the synthesis prepared students to use multiple strategies to solve problems and justify their solutions.

> Several studies also situated mathematics problem-solving within the context of social justice issues, such as power relations, societal oppression and global poverty.

I consider both the above goals of encouraging multiple ways to solve a problem and contextualizing lessons in larger social issues worthwhile, but largely aspirational goals for many teachers. Unfortunately, because math standards are so focused on mastering one concept at a time, such as applying the Pythagorean theorem, it also is easy to teach these concepts in isolation. Many of the problems available to teachers in textbooks or digital tools are similarly hyper focused on mastering the concept and as a result, funnel the student to use one strategy to solve the problem.

Similarly, because they're all about assessing mastering one concept in isolation, it becomes hard to connect that problem to a larger social issue. In general, social issues are extremely complex and rarely can using one technique make a dent in solving that problem.

Wanting to explore how math lessons could create opportunities for the above, I continued reading more literature on culturally responsive mathematics teaching (CRMT), including a <a href="https://www.curriculumassociates.com/-/media/mainsite/files/ready-classroom-mathematics/ready-classroom-mathematics-cultural-responsiveness-whitepaper-2019.pdf" target="_blank">white paper</a> on the topic that highlighted one example of a "lesson focused on identifying possible locations for a new cell phone tower" to teach students the Pythagorean theorem. After reviewing the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/366617413/tacib-cell-towers-unit?secret_password=QSO3ygjBeFnOFdO3seZ4#from_embed" target="_blank">teacher resources</a> provided for this lesson, I noted the following:

1. There were indeed multiple math concepts one can use to solve whether the location of a cell tower would provide coverage to residents, which included applying translations to circles, another <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/8/G/A/2/" target="_blank"> Common Core state standard</a>). This reinforces the finding in the research that culturally responsive mathematics can support multiple ways to solve a problem.
1. Because where to build cell towers is someone's responsibility in reality, the ultimate outcome of the unit was that students would write an argumentative essay to explain where cell towers should be built. In order to justify their results, students needed to understand a little bit about the science behind waves and their application to information transfer (<a href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/dci-arrangement/ms-ps4-waves-and-their-applications-technologies-information-transfer">a next gen science standard</a>!), read news articles about citizens' concerns with cell towers being built in their neighborhood, and of course, using math to inform the placement of those towers. This is a powerful way to link mathematics to social issues because the results of solving the math problem directly inform the student's decision making process.

Though I appreciated the interdisciplinary nature of the unit, I was concerned about the length of the unit, which would likely take at least a week to complete. The reality for many teachers, especially those teachers who teach math to students who are behind grade level, is they're pressured by the state assessment to cut aspects of lessons that might not be essential to mastering the concept. I could imagine these teachers in particular wishing there were a more bite-sized version of this lesson that would still capture the essence of culturally responsive mathematics, but in a more compact format.

In part 2, I'll explain the process of designing this more compact lesson and developing it in a digital form.
