        I'm Jeff! I'm grateful for the many educational opportunities I've been
        given and wish all students could have equitable access to a quality
        education. I'm on a journey to figure out ways, both small and large, in
        which I can make that happen.

      <h3> About This Blog</h3>
      <p>
        This blog serves as a space to share some of my thoughts on educational
        research / pedagogy and how to apply them to create compelling digital
        learning experiences. I first started learning to program because I
        wanted to create digital tools that would engage my students in
        learning. Now as an engineer, I still enjoy designing lessons, but have
        the ability to actually prototype them to experiment with what works and
        what doesn't. I'm designing these prototypes with the intention that if
        I were to ever go back to the classroom, I would actually use them.

        I played in my chemistry classes. During my time teaching, I worked to
        create an immersive learning environment, in which students played the
        role of scientists who mastered chemical principles to solve important
        missions and save humanity from the galaxyâ€™s many dangers. I was heavily
        influenced by Mass Effect, a videogame I was playing at the time that
        pushed me to create a learning experience that immersed my students in
        learning just like how Mass Effect immersed me in its storytelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the outlandish approach, I believe it played a non-trivial role
        in engaging students in chemistry, though it may not have been the most
        efficient way to engage students considering how much effort I put into
        it. This will likely be the topic of a future blog post.
