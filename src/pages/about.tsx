      <h3>About this Blog </h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy thinking about how tech can play a role in creating more
        engaging experiences for all learners and how it can help make education
        more equitable. This blog is a space to explore and prototype some of my
        ideas, good or bad, about how we can create better learning experiences
        with technology.

          Started learning to code while I was teaching to build more engaging

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJnls3P7Qe4">
          Commander King was the persona I played in my chemistry classes when I
          taught
        </a>
        . During my teaching, I worked to create an immersive learning
        environment, in which students play the role of scientists who master
        chemical principles to solve important missions and save humanity from
        the galaxyâ€™s many dangers. I was heavily influenced by the gaming world
        of Mass Effect at the time and wanted to create an experience that truly
        immersed my students in learning.
